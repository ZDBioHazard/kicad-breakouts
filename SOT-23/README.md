SOT-23 Breakout
---------------

This is a super-simple breakout for 3-pin SOT-23 package components.

The square pad on `P1` is pin 1. The pins on `P1` correspond to the SOT-23
footprint as shown in this diagram.

The pin labels on the back side match up with a dozen or so SOT-23 transistors
and MOSFETs I had laying around.
