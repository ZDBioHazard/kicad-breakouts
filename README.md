Simple Component Breakouts - For KiCAD
--------------------------------------

This is a library of simple breakout boards I've designed for various things.
There are probably pre-existing breakouts out there, but I made my own anyway.

Individual breakout descriptions are in the various project folders. Enjoy.

I tend to get a little carried away with making boards very tiny, so I'm sorry
if they are a bit difficult to assemble. Think of it as soldering practise. :)

The KiCAD files should be mostly self-contained, requiring only the KiCAD
built-in library. I took care to make sure the paths are relative to the
individual projects.

I'm still fairly new at EE, so if you see any electrical problems
with these designs, please let me know so I can learn more. :)
