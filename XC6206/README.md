XC6206 Breakout
---------------

This is a small breakout for the
[TOREX `XC6206`](http://www.torexsemi.com/products/voltage_regulators/data/XC6206.pdf)
and it's filter capacitors.

The `P1` pinout should be compatible with the usual `78xx` regulators.
Of course, the `XC6206` SOT-23 package is only rated to ~140mA for
5Vin/3.3Vout, so don't overdo it. ;)
